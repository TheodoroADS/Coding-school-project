# Coding-school-project
This is a school project that the brazilian highschool students Andr√© BL and Theodoro ADS did for coding class. Note: This is a project made by brazilian students, who used advices they got from youtube videos in english, for a french school, so there is a huge language mess inside the code. Sorry!
Here are some things you need to know:
- It is necessary to keep all the images inside the img folder and all the sounds outside it 
- The game map was made with a tool named TILED and you'll need it to run the game. You can download TILED with this addres(unless it's outdated) :https://www.mapeditor.org/download.html
- To develop this game, we used copyright-free material and tutorials. That is why we insisted in making this game copyright free aswell.
- This game runs in different speeds depending on which computer you are running it on. Sorry, we don't know how to fix it.
